after you git clone the source,you should download submodules:
cd vhall_media_core
git submodule init
git submodule update

before you build the project you should install cmake.And make sure it can be find under $PATH evironment.
If you cmake version is less than 3.7, the follow build cmd may cause error. You can open CMakeList.txt,
and remove the first line "cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.7)". Then try again. but we strongly recommand
you to install cmake3.7 or uper version.


windows build:
	open cmd console
	cd vhall_media_core
	md objs
	cd objs
	cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 12"  //12 means vs2013
	
project files while be created in objs open ALL_BUILD.sln and build it, target files will be created in objs/bin. 
if build debug it will be objs/bin/Debug and you need to copy all dlls in objs/bin to objs/bin/Debug manually to
run the test(now have not finished) and use the libs

if you build test application,you must add third libs as followsï¼š

Secur32.lib
Wininet.lib
Crypt32.lib
ws2_32.lib
Wsock32.lib
winmm.lib
kernel32.lib
user32.lib
gdi32.lib
winspool.lib
shell32.lib
ole32.lib
oleaut32.lib
uuid.lib
comdlg32.lib
advapi32.lib

#if your cmake version

	cd objs
	cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"
	make
	
target files while be in objs/bin
